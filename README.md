# WorkFlow

Welcome to WorkFlow, a draggable Kanban board to keep you productive throughout the day. Styled with Tailwind 2.0, including dark mode. Hooks into local storage to keep track of all the things on your agenda.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brittneypostma/workflow.git
cd workflow
npm install
git remote set upstream https://github.com/brittneypostma/workflow.git
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
